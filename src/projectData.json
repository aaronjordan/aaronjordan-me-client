    "text": "My role at Five Capitals began with assisting in ecommerce integration and has now led to leading development of a premium coaches' area of the website. This area enables coaches to find training and coaching documents. Before, the process was a mess of Google Drive sharing and outdated local PDFs. Now, there is a central hub where coaches can always access the latest tools. As I have limited access to the backend, I have used JQuery and CSS to generate and manipulate DOM elements to provide the new layouts and functionality.",

At the time, I wanted to build experience with vanilla ES6 Javascript, so the page uses the Fetch API for email submission and requires minimal frameworks. The backend server runs on Node.js with Express and Mailgun, which are the only dependencies of the project. The only external script loaded by the client is Font Awesome's CDN.",

Having a background in audio engineering and interest in digital signal processing, the topic of filtering was an exciting choice. I used a Terasic DE-10 Standard and some starter code on Github, which I mapped from the DE-2 to the DE-10 and filtered several audio samples through. Analysis of the harmonic texture of the filtered output is discussed in the report.",
